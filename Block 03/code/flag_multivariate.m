function [flag] = flag_multivariate (fileIn, sheetName, max_percent_diff,flag)

% Assesses the nature of the linear relationship between two variables
% through linear regression. Using the regression function the difference
% between the predicted value and the actual value is obtained. If the
% difference between the two values is greater than an threshold then the
% measurement is flagged according to the rules assigned in the lecture.

% Syntax: [flag] = flag_multivariate (fileIn, sheetName, max_percent_diff,flag)

% Inputs:
%  fileIn = excel spreadsheet containing the data to be assessed
%  sheetName = Name of the specific sheet to be loaded
%  max_percent_diff (optional) = maximum allowed difference between expected value
%  and the reported value. If this is not specified, the 95% ci will be
%  calculated (mean Â± 1.96 std)
%  flag (optional) = If a flag array has previously been created this can
%  be used as an input

%  Example 1:
%  [flag] = flag_multivariate ('C:\MSCL_MATLAB2.xls', '146',10,flag)

%  Example 2:
%  [flag] = flag_multivariate ('C:\MSCL_MATLAB2.xls', '146')

% Outputs:
% flag = The data will be assigned a flag which describes the status of the data. 
% If the flag array was used as an input variable it will be overwritten
